I just switched to League of Legends (not fully yet) and I am also still playing HOTS and there are some little features in LoL I‚Äòd wish to be implemented in Hots. 1. Enter Match Button: In LoL when you‚Äôre in queue and you found a match there will be a pop-up window where you have like 6 seconds to accept the game invite. If you do not accept you have to queue again (the other players you were matched with will stay in Q, they do not have to re-q and start at 0 again)

When did Riot start nerfing champion by doing major kit changes instead of balancing the numbers? Why is it important to nerf Kai'Sa's Q, by having it fire 10 instead of original 12 shots when evolved, instead of lowering its AD scaling, nerfing its dmg, increasing mana cost to not spam it as much etc. At what point Riot started approaching nerfs like this? Did number balancing seem too boring so they had to find more "creative" ways to balance the game? Spotlight videos Welcome to our new Spotlight Videos.

I really like Imperius and his playstyle. However, I feel like a few parts of his design don't quite click. Primarily, many of the qualities he needs in order to perform in his role are locked behind must-pick talents, as you can see from his talent pickrates and win rates.\ I have some thoughts on ways this could be improved, and wanted to see what people think. Kit Imperius's kit is really cool. However, at baseline , he feels like he lacks the tools he needs to perform. –¢–æ–ø–∏–∫–∏, —Ç–µ–º—ã, —Å–æ—á–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è, —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–∏, –≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞, –ø—Ä–µ–∑–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ–ø–∏–ª–∫–∞, —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∏ –Ω–∞ –≤–µ–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ä—ã –∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–µ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ - –≤—Å—ë –¥–ª—è —É—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, —É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –∏ —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π: —Å–∞–π—Ç.

Title. Sona's Champion Spotlight video is so out-dated at this point that it still says her Q gives AD/AP and her W gives armor/magic resist. It recommends building original Shureliya's Reverie, which was removed from the game for five years before being brought back again last season. Sona has gone through a partial visual update and two gameplay reworks, and her original spotlight video is no longer accurate to how her kit works in several ways--which I would think warrants an updated.
